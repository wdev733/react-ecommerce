### [Live Demo](https://era-ecommerce-react.firebaseapp.com)

## What is this??

> This is a modern ecommerce concept app made with React.js. I made this app for implementing and practicing things better. Moreoften **I work on the most important features to get different experiences.**  

## Future plans
> I am planning to implement these features:
> **Typescript;**
> **Unit-testing;**
> **Server-side on Python or Node.js**

## How this project can be helpful for you??
> If you are learning some new feature or technology, for instance, python for back-end. You could develop the back-end side for this app. And **you won't need to spent any time for developing front-end side.** You will not spent extra time for styling and designing the app. **Just fork me and do the work**
